name: Comments

Comments are useful for explaining what code does. Comments are ignored when your code runs, so you can write anything you want in them. Comments start on a new line with a `#` symbol. Here's an example:
```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello!")
```

Comments can be placed after a line of code. In this example, the comment explains what `print` does.
```python
print("Hello!") # this prints "Hello!" to the screen

# print("Hello!")
```

A comment has been added before the `print` on the last line. Notice how the code won't run. Everything after the `#` symbol is ignored by Python, including any code.
