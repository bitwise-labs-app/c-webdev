name: Using the REPL
---

Python has a built in program called the REPL. You can type in code and it will execute immediately. It's useful for quickly testing things, or using as a calculator!

<div class="info" data-header="Information">
REPL stands for **R**ead, **E**valuate, **P**rint, **L**oop. This means that it will **read** your input, **evaluate** the code, **print** the output, and then **loop**.
</div>

You can access it by typing `python` into your computer's terminal. IDLE also has the REPL open by default. The REPL shows a `>>>` where you type your code in.

Try typing `print("Hello!")` then pressing enter. Your code will get executed immediatley after. We've also included some math to demonstrate the calculation ability.
```python-repl
>>> print("Hello!")
Hello!
>>> 6+6
12
>>>
```
